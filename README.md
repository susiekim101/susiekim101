## 👋 Hi, I'm Susie Kim
I'm a UCLA computer science student passionate about building thoughtful, scalable software to simplify everyday tasks and enhance human capability. 

🌱 I’m especially interested in software engineering for impactful, user-facing technology and in humanoid robot learning systems designed for real-world deployment and human assistance. I love listening to podcasts on software engineering, AI, and recent advancements in robotics.

📝 I am building a developer's blog, where I post personal insights and explanations to Leetcode problems. Simply building for fun and to learn new tech stacks! : [dev blog](https://dev-blog-five-lac.vercel.app/)

🔭 I created an online 4-year course scheduler for UCLA Engineering students: [bruin-plan](https://github.com/susiekim101/bruin-plan/pulls)

🐷 I recently contributed to building an internal content management system for the Daily Bruin from scratch (yes, it's called Oink): [oink](https://oink.dailybruin.com/)
