## 👋 Hi, I'm Susie Kim
I'm a UCLA computer science student passionate about building thoughtful, scalable software to simplify everyday tasks and enhance human capability.

🌱 I’m especially interested in software engineering for impactful, user-facing technology and in humanoid robot learning systems designed for real-world deployment and human assistance.

🔭 I’m currently building an online 4-year course scheduler for UCLA Engineering students: [bruin-plan](https://github.com/susiekim101/bruin-plan/pulls)

🐷 I recently contributed to building an internal content management system for the Daily Bruin from scratch (yes, it's called Oink): [oink](https://oink.dailybruin.com/)
